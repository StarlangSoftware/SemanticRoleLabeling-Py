# Semantic Role Labeling

## Task Definition

Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a well-defined task where the objective is to analyze propositions expressed by the verb. In SRL, each word that bears a semantic role in the sentence has to be identified. There are different types of arguments (also called ’thematic roles’) such as Agent, Patient, Instrument, and also of adjuncts, such as Locative, Temporal, Manner, and Cause. These arguments and adjuncts represent entities participating in the event and give information about the event characteristics.

In the field of SRL, PropBank is one of the studies widely recognized by the computational linguistics communities. PropBank is the bank of propositions where predicate- argument information of the corpora is annotated, and the semantic roles or arguments that each verb can take are posited.

Each verb has a frame file, which contains arguments applicable to that verb. Frame files may include more than one roleset with respect to the senses of the given verb. In the roleset of a verb sense, argument labels Arg0 to Arg5 are described according to the meaning of the verb. For the example below, the predicate is “announce” from PropBank, Arg0 is “announcer”, Arg1 is “entity announced”, and ArgM- TMP is “time attribute”.

[<sub>ARG0</sub> Türk Hava Yolları] [<sub>ARG1</sub> indirimli satışlarını] [<sub>ARGM-TMP</sub> bu Pazartesi] [<sub>PREDICATE</sub> açıkladı].

[<sub>ARG0</sub> Turkish Airlines] [<sub>PREDICATE</sub> announced] [<sub>ARG1</sub> its discounted fares] [<sub>ARGM-TMP</sub> this Monday].

The following Table shows typical semantic role types. Only Arg0 and Arg1 indicate the same thematic roles across different verbs: Arg0 stands for the Agent or Causer and Arg1 is the Patient or Theme. The rest of the thematic roles can vary across different verbs. They can stand for Instrument, Start point, End point, Beneficiary, or Attribute. Moreover, PropBank uses ArgM’s as modifier labels indicating time, location, temporal, goal, cause etc., where the role is not specific to a single verb group; it generalizes over the entire corpus instead.

|Tag|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Arg0|Agent or Causer|
|ArgM-EXT|Extent|
|Arg1|Patient or Theme|
|ArgM-LOC|Locatives|
|Arg2|Instrument, start point, end point, beneficiary, or attribute|
|ArgM-CAU|Cause|
|ArgM-MNR|Manner|
|ArgM-DIS|Discourse|
|ArgM-ADV|Adverbials|
|ArgM-DIR|Directionals|
|ArgM-PNC|Purpose|
|ArgM-TMP|Temporals|

## Data Annotation

### Preparation

1. Collect a set of sentences to annotate. 
2. Each sentence in the collection must be named as xxxx.yyyyy in increasing order. For example, the first sentence to be annotated will be 0001.train, the second 0002.train, etc.
3. Put the sentences in the same folder such as *Turkish-Phrase*.
4. Build the [Java](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/SemanticRoleLabeling) project and put the generated sentence-propbank-predicate.jar and sentence-propbank-argument.jar files into another folder such as *Program*.
5. Put *Turkish-Phrase* and *Program* folders into a parent folder.

### Predicate Annotation

1. Open sentence-propbank-predicate.jar file.
2. Wait until the data load message is displayed.
3. Click Open button in the Project menu.
4. Choose a file for annotation from the folder *Turkish-Phrase*.  
5. For each predicate word in the sentence, click the word, and choose PREDICATE tag for that word.
6. Click one of the next buttons to go to other files.

### Argument Annotation

1. Open sentence-propbank-argument.jar file.
2. Wait until the data load message is displayed.
3. Click Open button in the Project menu.
4. Choose a file for annotation from the folder *Turkish-Phrase*.  
5. For each word in the sentence, click the word, and choose correct argument tag for that word.
6. Click one of the next buttons to go to other files.

## Classification DataSet Generation

After annotating sentences, you can use [DataGenerator](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/DataGenerator-Py) package to generate classification dataset for the Semantic Role Labeling task.

## Generation of ML Models

After generating the classification dataset as above, one can use the [Classification](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/Classification-Py) package to generate machine learning models for the Semantic Role Labeling task.

Detailed Description
============

The first task in Semantic Role Labeling is detecting predicates. In order to detect the predicates of the sentence, we use autoPredicate method of the TurkishSentenceAutoPredicate class.

	sentence = ...
	turkishAutoPredicate = TurkishSentenceAutoPredicate(FramesetList())
	turkishAutoPredicate.autoPredicate(sentence)
	
Afterwards, one has to annotate the arguments for each predicate. We use autoArgument method of the TurkishSentenceAutoArgument class for that purpose.

	turkishAutoArgument.autoArgument(sentence)

```
    packages=['Classification', 'Classification.Model', 'Classification.Model.DecisionTree',
              'Classification.Model.Ensemble', 'Classification.Model.NeuralNetwork',
              'Classification.Model.NonParametric', 'Classification.Model.Parametric',

```

### Python files
1. Do not forget to comment each function.
```
    def __broadcast_shape(self, shape1: Tuple[int, ...], shape2: Tuple[int, ...]) -> Tuple[int, ...]:
        """
        Determines the broadcasted shape of two tensors.

        :param shape1: Tuple representing the first tensor shape.
        :param shape2: Tuple representing the second tensor shape.
        :return: Tuple representing the broadcasted shape.
        """
```
2. Function names should follow caml case.
```
    def addItem(self, item: str):
```
3. Local variables should follow snake case.
```
	det = 1.0
	copy_of_matrix = copy.deepcopy(self)
```
4. Class variables should be declared in each file.
```
class Eigenvector(Vector):
    eigenvalue: float
```
5. Variable types should be defined for function parameters and class variables.
```
    def getIndex(self, item: str) -> int:
```
6. For abstract methods, use ABC package and declare them with @abstractmethod.
```
    @abstractmethod
    def train(self, train_set: list[Tensor]):
        pass
```
7. For private methods, use __ as prefix in their names.
```
    def __infer_shape(self, data: Union[List, List[List], List[List[List]]]) -> Tuple[int, ...]:
```
8. For private class variables, use __ as prefix in their names.
```
class Matrix(object):
    __row: int
    __col: int
    __values: list[list[float]]
```
9. Write \_\_repr\_\_ class methods as toString methods
10. Write getter and setter class methods.
```
    def getOptimizer(self) -> Optimizer:
        return self.optimizer
    def setValue(self, value: Optional[Tensor]) -> None:
        self._value = value
```
11. If there are multiple constructors for a class, define them as constructor1, constructor2, ..., then from the original constructor call these methods.
```
    def constructor1(self):
        self.__values = []
        self.__size = 0

    def constructor2(self, values: list):
        self.__values = values.copy()
        self.__size = len(values)

    def __init__(self,
                 valuesOrSize=None,
                 initial=None):
        if valuesOrSize is None:
            self.constructor1()
        elif isinstance(valuesOrSize, list):
            self.constructor2(valuesOrSize)
```
12. Extend test classes from unittest and use separate unit test methods.
```
class TensorTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_inferred_shape(self):
        a = Tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
        self.assertEqual((2, 2), a.getShape())

    def test_shape(self):
        a = Tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
        self.assertEqual((3, ), a.getShape())
```
13. Enumerated types should be used when necessary as enum classes.
```
class AttributeType(Enum):
    """
    Continuous Attribute
    """
    CONTINUOUS = auto()
    """
    Discrete Attribute
    """
    DISCRETE = auto()
```
